# About
Having started my career from junior in the security field, then I've been in the backend engineering.

My strength is agile and stable programming skills as follows:
 - Experienced python skill for quick Implementation of PoC/product with changeable requirements.
 - Go(Golang) skill with static type, compilation and native binary, which complementary to python, when high performance is necessary.
 - Learning OOP to design a well-structured program.
 - Basic DB skill, started from MySQL then I'm using Postgresql now.
 - Shallow but wide experience, besides above, I've dealt with VB6.0/AS2.0/WPF/WinForm/HTML/CSS/JS/Processing/C/C++/MySQL/Digital forensic but not now.
