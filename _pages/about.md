## About me
Having started my career from the digital forensic, a part of the information security, then in the back-end engineering now.  
I said back-end, but I'm also interested in broad topics like Cloud, OOP, DB, Network, Container, Microservice, DevOps, etc....  


## About here
As you already know, I'm not a native English speaker and have poor English skill too. But I think not using English makes my English skill get worse. To get over it, I'll manage this blog with English.

    -   Tutorial / Guide /Explanation / Reference
-   Study:
    -   Programming / Design / Algorithm
    -   OS / Network / Security / DB
