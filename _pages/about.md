## About me
Having started my career from the digital forensic, a part of the information security, then in the back-end engineering now.  
I said back-end, but I'm also interested in broad topics like Cloud, OOP, DB, Network, Container, Microservice, DevOps, etc....  


## About here
As you already know, I'm not a native English speaker and have poor English skill too. But I think not using English makes my English skill get worse. To get over it, I'll manage this blog with English.
This blog will be used with mainly 7 categories as follows:  
Tutorials / How-to guides / Explanation / Reference / Life / English / Misc.
