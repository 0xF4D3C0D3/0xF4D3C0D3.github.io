## About me
Having started my career from the digital forensic, a part of the information security, then in the back-end engineering now.  
I said back-end, but I'm also interested in broad topics like Cloud, OOP, DB, Network, Container, PL, DevOps, etc....  


## About here
As you already know, I'm not a native English speaker and have poor English skill too. But I think not using English makes my English skill get worse. To get over it, I'll manage this blog with English.
This blog will be used with mainly six categories as Tutorials / How-to guides / Explanation / Reference / Life / English.
