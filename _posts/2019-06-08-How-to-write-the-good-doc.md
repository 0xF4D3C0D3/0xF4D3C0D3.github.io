## Introduction
Many people try to write good docs, but most of them fail.
Why do they fail (include me)?
That's because we have done it in the wrong way.
How can we do it better?
Let's read [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/) to write better docs

## The secret
There are four categories in the documentation of the software:
  - Tutorials
  - How-to guides
  - Explanation
  - Technical reference
  
### Tutorials
  - is **learning-oriented**
  - allows the newcomer to get started
  - is a lesson
  
*Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook*

### How-to guides
  - is **goal-oriented**
  - shows how to solve a specific problem
  - is a series of steps
  
*Analogy: a recipe in a cookery book*

### Explanation
  - is **understanding-oriented**
  - explains
  - provides background and context
  
*Analogy: an article on culinary social history*

### Reference
  - is **information-oriented**
  - describes the machinery
  - is accurate and complete

*Analogy: a reference encyclopaedia article*

Above division makes writing and reading posts easier in *How to write*, *What to write*, *Where to write* perspectives.

### Project documentation
Q $\to$ Where do things like *changelogs*, *contribution policy*, *other information about the project* go into which category?  
A $\to$ None of them because they are *project documentation* rather than *software documentation*

## How to write good tutorials?
1. **Make the begginer can do something** through your tutorials.
1. **Lower the barrier to entry** to get the user easily started.
1. **Ensure the robust tutorial** that can be done by students without a teacher is written.
1. **Let the beginners get small results, but meaningful and immediate**, rather than the one big result.
1. **Make the tutorials be reliably repeatable** regardless of OS, environment, level of users.
1. **Write the concrete steps**, not abstract concepts.
1. **Provide the minimum necessary explanation**, make it as a link if more explanation needed.
1. **Focus only on steps the user needs to take**, don't be too verbose. 

## How to write good how-to guides?
1. **Provide a series of steps**, but don't need to lower barriers for starting point.
1. **Focus on results achieving a practical goal.**
1. **Give an speicific answer** about the question *How do I ...?*
1. **Don't explain concepts**, rather link them.
1. As requirements could be variability, **allow for some flexibility.**
1. **Leave only important things**, don't try to get completeness.
1. **Name them well** to enough to the users should tell what it does.

## How to write good reference?
1. **Structure the documentation around the code** so that the user can navigate the doc and code at the same time.
1. Make **structure, tone, format must all be consistent** like an encyclopedia.
1. **Do nothing but describe** as clearly and completely as possible.
1. **Keep it up-to-date and accurate.**

## How to write good Explanation?
1. **Provide context** that explaining why things are so &mdash; design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints. 
1. **Discuss alternatives and opinions** to provide multiple different approaches.
1. **Do not instruct, or provide technical reference.** Do only what others(tutorial, guide, reference) can't do.
