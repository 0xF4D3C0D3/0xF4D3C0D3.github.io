The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the
Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology
with a scale like that was so error-free?
—Alan Kay, in interview with Dr Dobb’s Journal (2012)

The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
—Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922)

Wer Ordnung hält, ist nur zu faul zum Suchen.
(If you keep things tidily ordered, you’re just too lazy to go searching.)
—German proverb

Everything changes and nothing stands still.
—Heraclitus of Ephesus, as quoted by Plato in Cratylus (360 BCE)

The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly
go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out
to be impossible to get at or repair.
—Douglas Adams, Mostly Harmless (1992)

Clearly, we must break away from the sequential and not limit the computers. We must
state definitions and provide for priorities and descriptions of data. We must state relationships,
not procedures.
—Grace Murray Hopper, Management and the Computer of the Future (1962)

Some authors have claimed that general two-phase commit is too expensive to support,
because of the performance or availability problems that it brings. We believe it is better to
have application programmers deal with performance problems due to overuse of transactions
as bottlenecks arise, rather than always coding around the lack of transactions.
—James Corbett et al., Spanner: Google’s Globally-Distributed Database (2012)

Hey I just met you
The network’s laggy
But here’s my data
So store it maybe
—Kyle Kingsbury, Carly Rae Jepsen and the Perils of Network Partitions (2013)

Is it better to be alive and wrong or right and dead?
—Jay Kreps, A Few Notes on Kafka and Jepsen (2013)

A system cannot be successful if it is too strongly influenced by a single person. Once the
initial design is complete and fairly robust, the real test begins as people with many different
viewpoints undertake their own experiments.
—Donald Knuth

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that
works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from
scratch never works and cannot be made to work.
—John Gall, Systemantics (1975)

If a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation
of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship
entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation.
(Often quoted as: If the highest aim of a captain was the preserve his ship, he would keep it
in port forever.)
—St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica (1265–1274)
