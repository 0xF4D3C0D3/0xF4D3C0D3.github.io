# Overview

To store state, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header in an
HTTP response.  In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a
Cookie request header to the origin server.  The Cookie header
contains cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie
headers.  The origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or
use its contents for an application-defined purpose.

## Examples

Using the Set-Cookie header, a server can send the user agent a short
string in an HTTP response that the user agent will return in future
HTTP requests that are within the scope of the cookie.  For example,
the server can send the user agent a "session identifier" named SID
with the value 31d4d96e407aad42.  The user agent then returns the
session identifier in subsequent requests.

The server can alter the default scope of the cookie using the Path
and Domain attributes.  For example, the server can instruct the user
agent to return the cookie to every path and every subdomain of
example.com.

== Server -> User Agent ==

Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Domain=example.com
