## Overview
I'm gonna move my career to the DevOps from the backend engineer next year, because I don't wanna be strongly bounded with some specific frameworks like Django or Flask. Of course, that's not their fault, I think I just don't mix well with them.
So after moving my career, I wouldn't focus on specific frameworks or libraries rather I will focus on architecture, pipeline, OS, server and CI/CD, etc.

The below list is my study plan.
